<h2>Project Name - StarText</h2> <br>
StarLetter is a fascinating project developed in the C programming language that showcases the artistry of coding.
Through Complex patterns of stars, the program beautifully renders letters of the alphabet.
Each letter is carefully designed using a combination of asterisks, allowing the user to visualize the elegance of typography through a programmer's lens.
